# Getting Started with Openlayers

This project is a technical challenge by OroraTech. For the development of this app I used React, Openlayers and D3 library.

The app fetches geo data from a url and displays it as a cluster layer on the map.Red means that the system is confident that this cluster is on fire and blue otherwise. When you click on the cluster a popup would appear which shares the meta data from the geojson file. I have also extended the map menu and added three buttons. The button V changes the hides the visibility of the clusters, button W shows the average hotspot count for the data and button D shows dwo diagrams one for the age of each cluster and one for the hotspot count per cluster. 

I also deployed the react app to GitHub Pages in order to make the project visible.
